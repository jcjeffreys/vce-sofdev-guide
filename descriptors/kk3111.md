# Searching algorithms

The ability to search for data is important for many programs. This may be a direct requirement of the user, or it may be necessary for some other function that the program performs. It is also important for searching to be _efficient_, especially with such large data sets that need to be worked with.

In VCE Software Development, we need to know about two searching algorithms: _linear search_, and _binary search_.

## Linear search

A linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. It simply checks each element of the list from first to last to see if it matches the target value.

You can watch a [demonstration of linear search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwsgCHYmbbA) to aid your understanding of the algorithm.

**To fully understand linear search, you should aim to memorise the simple explanation, and use this to write the full algorithm in pseudocode.**

### Pseudocode

The following pseudocode is for your reference only. You should not try to memorise it; instead you should understand the concept of linear search so that you could write the pseudocode yourself.

```
BEGIN LinearSearch(array, target)
    found <-- False
    FOR item IN array
        IF item = target
            found <-- True
            BREAK
    RETURN found
```

## Binary search

ðŸš§ Come back here for an update, but until then, take a look at the [Wikipedia page for binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Algorithm).
