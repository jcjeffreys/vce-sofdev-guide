# Project management

Project management is the process of **planning**, **organising**, and **monitoring** a project that helps ensure it is completed on time, within budget, and in scope. Poorly managed projects can be damaging to an organisations operations and profit.

You will need to complete a project plan for your SAT project, so this is an important topic!

## Gantt charts

A _Gantt chart_ is a graphical representation of a project plan, which could be described as a combination of a bar chart and a timeline. Gantt charts:

* list all tasks in a project
* organise the tasks in order
* show which tasks need to wait for other tasks to be completed
* allocate people and resources to tasks
* track the progress of tasks and the project as a whole

Gantt charts can be created using purpose-designed [software](#software), but you should be familiar with using pen and paper as well, as this will be required on the exam.

It is important that you understand the [concepts](#concepts) and [processes](#processes) related to Gantt charts, not just how to create them using software.

### Examples

The following examples are taken from VCE SofDev exams. Note that they are not formatted in the exact same way.

## Concepts

### Milestones

_Milestones_ represent the completion of a significant stage in a project. In some Gantt charts, a milestone is indicated at the end of a particular task. In others, the milestone is itself a task with zero time duration (as is the case when using [GanttProject](#ganttproject)).

An example milestone would be having completed the printing of a questionnaire, following the required tasks of research, writing, and proofreading the questionnaire. This example is illustrated in [GanttProject](#ganttproject) below.

![An example of a zero-time-duration milestone as used in GanttProject](/images/milestone-ganttproject.png)

Note the representation of the milestone using a small diamond. Have a look at the earlier examples from the SofDev exams. How are milestones shown on these charts?

### Dependencies

Also known as _predecessors_, _dependencies_ are tasks that must be completed before another task can be started. Tasks that have dependencies are called _successors_. In the example above, we can see that _Proofreading_ has the dependency _Writing_, becase you cannot proofread something that has not been written! But, you also cannot write something that has not been researched, so the _Writing_ task has its own dependencies as well.

Dependencies are indicated on Gantt charts using arrows.

## Processes

### Task identification

Projects need to be broken down insto smaller, more manageable tasks. Your SAT project for example could be broken down to include some of the following tasks:

* Identify a client
* Analyse the client's needs and requirements
* Create a Gantt chart
* Create a title for your software
* ...

To break down your tasks, you should develop a **work breakdown structure (WBS)** and draw a WBS diagram to accompany it. For large projects, the WBS may be hierarchical, and break tasks into smaller subtasks, and those subtasks into even small subtasks.

❗️ Do not leave any tasks out of your WBS!

The following is an example of a WBS for the SAT project in Unit 3 Outcome 2. Note that while is is a good illustration of how to create and use a WSB, it does not contain the required level of detail.

### Sequencing

After identifying the individual tasks that make up your project, you need to estimate how long each task will take, and then put them in a sequence (correct order). Dependencies should also be decided.

Some tasks can be completed _concurrently_ (i.e. at the same time). For example, you may concurrently conduct research for creating your survey while you write the questions in the survey.

If a predecessor runs overtime, its successors will be delayed which can affect the deadlines of future tasks. Gantt charts help to monitor tasks and therefore reduce the likelihood of catastrophic delays by allowing project managers to anticipate problems.

Some tasks can be delayed without affecting the project completion date. The amount of time that these tasks can be delayed is called _slack time_. Slack time can present an opportunity to reassign resources to other tasks.

### Critical path

A project's _critical path_ is the sequence of tasks from beginning to end, which:

* contains no slack time
* is the longest duration
* is the minimum time possible to complete the project.

Sometimes a project may have more than one critical path. No task on the critical path can be delayed without affecting the end date of the entire project.

### Documentation

![Gantt chart example taken from the Nelson textbook](/images/gantt-chart-example.png)

You will use your Gantt chart to document your progress throughout your SAT project. You will include information about the progress of tasks and the planned and actual duration of tasks.

You will also document the resources you have allocated to tasks such as tools and equipment. While organisations may include people and buildings as resources, your resources might be computers, software, and data sets.

You should frequently modify your Gantt chart to reflect _contingencies_. Contingencies are unforeseen events that affect your project. For example, if your computer is stolen and you lose some of your data, this would be a contingency that affects the time of tasks in your project, and may affect its end date.

## Software

There are many software solutions available to create and manage Gantt charts, in fact a past SofDev student created software to create and manage Gantt charts for their SAT project!

In SofDev, I recommend the use of [GanttProject](#ganttproject). You may also choose to create a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (Gantt chart templates for these are available online).

### GanttProject

GanttProject ([website](https://www.ganttproject.biz/)) is a free and open-source program for creating and managing Gantt charts.
