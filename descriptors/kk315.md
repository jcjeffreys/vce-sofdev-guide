Once the reqruiements of your software have been determined, it is important to plan how the software will meet those requirements. This allows you to forsee and prevent potential issues, and generally improve the eifficiency of development.

## Data dictionaries

A _data dictionary_ allows you to plan how your software stores information in various elements including variables, data structures and objects. **A data dictionary should include every variable's name and data type or structure**. Additionally, it may include the data's purpose, source, size, description, formatting and validation.

Data dictionaries are especially useful when other programmers need to read or modify code, and the purpose of variables may be unclear.

An example of a simple program and its data dictionary:

```python
# A silly script
name = input("Enter your name: ")
num = int(input("Enter your favourite number: "))
message = num*name
print(message)
```
| Variable name | Type | Description | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Stores the user's name | Existence check |
| num | integer | Stores the user's favourite number | Type check, and round floats to whole number |
| message | string | Message to be printed (num*name) | No validation required |
