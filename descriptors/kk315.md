## Data dictionaries

A _data dictionary_ allows you to plan how your software stores information in various elements including variables, data structures and objects. **A data dictionary should include every variable's name and data type or structure**. Additionally, it may include the data's purpose, source, size, description, formatting and validation.

Data dictionaries are especially useful when other programmers need to read or modify code, and the purpose of variables may be unclear.
