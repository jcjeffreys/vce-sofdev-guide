# Processing features of a programming language

There are a number of features of programming languages that you need to be familiar with. Much like being aware of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and how to use them when speaking English; you must be familiar with variables, control structures, and functions (and more) when programming in any language.

## Variables

Variables store data so that they can be retrieved later within a program.

The data that variables contain has both a **value**, and a **type**. In some programming languages, variables must be _declared_ with the type of data it will contain, but this is not necessary in Python.

### Variables in Python

To create variables in Python, we use the `=` operator. The variable name goes on the left of the operator, and the value being assigned goes on the right.

The data type is automatically assigned because Python is a _dynamically typed_ language.

It is important to note that certain [rules](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp) must be followed when naming variables in Python. For example, variable names cannot begin with a number.

## Instructions

An **instruction** is a unit of code that can be executed by a _compiler_ or _interpreter_. There are two types of instructions in programming:

* **Definitions:** instructions that assign values to variables
* **Statements:** instructions that perform a single action

Here are some examples of instructions in Python:

```python
# Definition: store a value in a variable
variable1 = 42
# Statement: recall the value of a variable and print it
print(variable1)

>>> 42
```

## Control structures

Control structures are instructions or groups of instructions that determine the order in which instructions are executed.

There are three fundamental control structures in programming:

* Sequences
* Conditions (selections, or if statements)
* Iterations (loops)

### Sequences

A **sequence** is a set of instructions that executes line by line, in the order they are written.

An example of a sequence in Python:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.")
```

The above sequence executes three instructions. The first two lines are definitions that assign values based on user input, and the last instruction is a statement that prints out a message. _Each line of code is run in order and only once_.

### Conditionals

Sometimes programmers want their programs to behave differently when certain things happen. To do this, we use conditionals (also known as selections). Conditions are [boolean](./kk319.md#boolean)

### Iterations

The following is an example of a conditional in Python, using [comparison](kk311#comparison) operators:

```python
if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")

if a != b:
    print("a and b are not equal")
```

Conditional statements can also include an _alternative execution_. This means if the condition is false, instead of not executing the instructions, different instructions are executed instead.

The following example will return the same result as the previous example using an alternative execution:

```python
if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")

else:
    print("a and b are not equal")
```

If you need more than two directions your code can go, you can use a _chained conditional_. Chained conditionals need to have their own logic at each possibility, and you can optionally add an `else` at the end to cover all other possibilities:

```python
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

elif a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
    
else:
    print("a is equal to b")
```
