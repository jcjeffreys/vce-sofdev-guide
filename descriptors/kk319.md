### How to use variables in Python

To create variables in Python, we use the `=` operator. The variable name goes on the left of the operator, and the value being assigned goes on the right.

> `my_variable = 42`

The data type is automatically assigned because Python is a _dynamically typed_ language.

It is important to note that certain [rules](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp) must be followed when naming variables in Python. For example, variable names cannot begin with a number.
