# Characteristics of data types

_This section is under construction, so please check back for updates._ ðŸš§

A data type is an attribute of data. All pieces of data must have a data type, including [variables](kk319.md#variables). The data type tells the computer what the programmer intends to do with the data; how it can be manipulated with [operations](#operations).[^1]

## Numeric

There are several different numeric data types. Numeric data types can have all [mathematical operations](#mathematical) performed on them. Numeric data types can also be compared, using [comparison operations](#comparison).

### Integer

Integers are used to store whole number data. There are some limits to integers used by computers, which can lead to critical errors.

To understand the limits of integers, we need to know how they are represented internally in a computer system: using a group of binary digits called _bits_. This is perhaps best explained using an example:

> _Represent the number 42 using an 8-bit system_
>
> 42 = 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup>
>
> Start with 8 bits set to zero: `00000000`  
Set the 2nd bit (representing 2<sup>1</sup>) to one: `00000010`  
Set the 4th bit (representing 2<sup>3</sup>) to one: `00001010`  
Set the 6th bit (representing 2<sup>5</sup>) to one: `00101010`

As you can see, we can comfortably represent the number 42 using an 8-bit integer. However, clearly there is an upper limit to the numbers we can represent: the binary number `11111111`.

> `11111111` = 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>7</sup>  
= 2<sup>8</sup> - 1  
= 255

It's no wonder Pac-Man (an 8-bit video game) goes weird when a player gets to level 256!

Modern computing systems are usually 32-bit or 64-bit, so the limits are much higher:

| Computer system | Minimum unsigned integer | Maximum unsigned integer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 32-bit | 0 | 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 = 4,294,967,295 |
| 64-bit | 0 | 2<sup>64</sup> - 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |

Integers can also be _signed_ (as opposed to _unsigned_) which means we can have integers that are negative. In order to accomplish this, we sacrifice one bit so that it can indicate whether the integer is positive or negative.

| Computer system | Minimum signed integer | Maximum signed integer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 32-bit | -2<sup>31</sup> | 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 |
| 64-bit | -2<sup>63</sup> | 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 |

### Floating point

Floating point numbers, also referred to as 'floats' are used to represent real numbers; meaning they can represent decimal numbers.

Floating points consist of:
* a _significand_, which contains the digits in the number, either positive or negative
* an _exponent_, which determines where the decimal point is placed within the significand

Depending on the computer system (32-bit or 64-bit) floats are either single or double precision, and are referred to as 'singles' or 'doubles' respectively.

If you like, you can refer to an [example of how floating point numbers are represented using bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Internal_representation)[^2].

## Text

Text data types can also undergo some mathematical operations, but this depends on the programming language and the behaviour may seem strange. In Python, for example:

> `3*'Hello' = 'HelloHelloHello'`

Comparison and logical operators can be used as well.

### Character

The character data type contains a symbol. This could be a letter, number, punctuation mark, space, or other symbol.

Characters are _encoded_ so that a computer program can translate the binary representation of a symbol into a meaningful character. Some examples of character-encoding schemes are ASCII and UTF-8.

### String

A sequence of characters forms a string data type. The string 'Hello World!' is 12 characters long, which includes the space and exclamation mark.

## Logical

There is only one logical data type.

### Boolean

The only logical data type, Boolean, is used to represent the two possible values when conducting Boolean logic: _True_ and _False_.

Boolean data types are often used with comparison and logical operations to make decisions.

## Operations

### Mathematical

| Operation | Python operator |
| --- | :---: |
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Division | `/` |
| Whole number division | `//` |
| Remainder after division | `%` |
| Exponent | `**` |
| Assign value | `=` |

If there are multiple operations in a line of code, the order of operations follows the same rules as in mathematics: brackets, exponent (order), division and multiplication, addition and subtraction. If two operators share precedence, they are evaluated from left to right.

### Comparison

| Operation | Python operator |
| --- | :---: |
| Less than | `<` |
| Less than or equal to | `<=` |
| Greater than | `>` |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=` |
| Equal to | `==` |
| Not equal to | `!=` |

### Logical

| Operation | Python operator |
| --- | :---: |
| AND | `and` |
| OR | `or` |
| NOT | `not` |
