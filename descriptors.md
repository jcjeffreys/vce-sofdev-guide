## Unit 3 Outcome 1: programming

### Key knowledge

#### Data and information

1. [characteristics of data types](descriptors/kk311.md)
2. [types of data structures, including associative arrays (or dictionaries or hash tables), one-dimensional arrays (single data type, integer index) and records (varying data types, field index)](descriptors/kk312.md)

#### Approaches to problem solving

3. methods for documenting a problem, need or opportunity
4. methods for determining solution requirements, constraints and scope
5. [methods of representing designs, including data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions and pseudocode](descriptors/kk315.md)
6. formatting and structural characteristics of files, including delimited (CSV), plain text (TXT) and XML file formats
7. a programming language as a method for developing working modules that meet specified needs
8. [naming conventions for solution elements](descriptors/kk318.md)
9. [processing features of a programming language, including classes, control structures, functions, instructions and methods](descriptors/kk319.md) 
10. [algorithms for sorting, including selection sort and quick sort](descriptors/kk3110.md)
11. algorithms for binary and linear searching
12. [validation techniques, including existence checking, range checking and type checking](descriptors/kk3112.md)
13. [techniques for checking that modules meet design specifications, including trace tables and construction of test data](descriptors/kk3113.md) 
14. [purposes and characteristics of internal documentation, including meaningful comments and syntax.](descriptors/kk3114.md)

### Key skills

1. interpret solution requirements and designs to develop working modules
2. use a range of data types and data structures
3. use and justify appropriate processing features of a programming language to develop working modules
4. develop and apply suitable validation, testing and debugging techniques using appropriate test data
5. document the functioning of modules and the use of processing features through internal documentation.
