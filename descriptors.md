## Unit 3 Outcome 1: programming

### Key knowledge

#### Data and information

1. [characteristics of data types](descriptors/kk311.md)
2. [types of data structures, including associative arrays (or dictionaries or hash tables), one-dimensional arrays (single data type, integer index) and records (varying data types, field index)](descriptors/kk312.md)

#### Approaches to problem solving

3. methods for documenting a problem, need or opportunity
4. methods for determining solution requirements, constraints and scope
5. [methods of representing designs, including data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions and pseudocode](descriptors/kk315.md)
6. [formatting and structural characteristics of files, including delimited (CSV), plain text (TXT) and XML file formats](descriptors/kk316.md)
7. a programming language as a method for developing working modules that meet specified needs
8. [naming conventions for solution elements](descriptors/kk318.md)
9. [processing features of a programming language, including classes, control structures, functions, instructions and methods](descriptors/kk319.md) 
10. [algorithms for sorting, including selection sort and quick sort](descriptors/kk3110.md)
11. [algorithms for binary and linear searching](descriptors/kk3111.md)
12. [validation techniques, including existence checking, range checking and type checking](descriptors/kk3112.md)
13. [techniques for checking that modules meet design specifications, including trace tables and construction of test data](descriptors/kk3113.md) 
14. [purposes and characteristics of internal documentation, including meaningful comments and syntax.](descriptors/kk3114.md)

### Key skills

1. interpret solution requirements and designs to develop working modules
2. use a range of data types and data structures
3. use and justify appropriate processing features of a programming language to develop working modules
4. develop and apply suitable validation, testing and debugging techniques using appropriate test data
5. document the functioning of modules and the use of processing features through internal documentation.

## Unit 3 Outcome 2: analysis and design

### Key knowledge

#### Digital systems

1. security considerations influencing the design of solutions, including authentication and data protection
Data and information
2. techniques for collecting data to determine needs and requirements, including interviews, observation, reports and surveys
â€ƒ
#### Approaches to problem solving

3. functional and non-functional requirements
4. constraints that influence solutions, including economic, legal, social, technical and usability
5. factors that determine the scope of solutions
6. features and purposes of software requirement specifications
7. tools and techniques for depicting the interfaces between solutions, users and networks, including use case diagrams created using UML
8. features of context diagrams and data flow diagrams
9. techniques for generating design ideas
10. criteria for evaluating the alternative design ideas and the efficiency and effectiveness of solutions
11. methods of expressing solution designs using data dictionaries, mock-ups, object descriptions and pseudocode
12. factors influencing the design of solutions, including affordance, interoperability, marketability, security and usability
13. characteristics of user experiences, including efficient and effective user interfaces
14. development model approaches, including agile, spiral and waterfall
15. [features of project management using Gantt charts, including the identification and sequencing of tasks, time allocation, dependencies, milestones and critical path](descriptors/kk3215.md)

#### Interactions and impact

16. goals and objectives of organisations and information systems
17. key legal requirements relating to the ownership and privacy of data and information.

### Key skills

1. select a range of methods to collect and interpret data for analysis
2. select and justify the use of an appropriate development model
3. apply analysis tools and techniques to determine solution requirements, constraints and scope
4. document an analysis as a software requirements specification
5. generate alternative design ideas
6. develop evaluation criteria to select and justify preferred designs 
7. produce detailed designs using appropriate design methods and techniques
8. create, monitor and modify project plans using software.
