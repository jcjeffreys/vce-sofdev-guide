# Your first assignment

## Hello world!

It is tradition to test out any new programming system by writing a _Hello World_. Here, we will be testing your new IDE and GitHub account.

_Before you start, make sure you have finished all the [previous steps](README.md#first-time) on the SofDev Guide homepage._

## Where do I go?

To _accept_ assignments, you will need to follow a provided link.

To _submit_ your assignments, you will use Git to push them to GitHub Classroom (you can do this from within VSCode).

_Note: you will be prompted to do a few things the first time you open an assignment with VSCode:_

* install the GitHub Classroom extension
* authorise VSCode's access to GitHub
* sign in to your GitHub account in VSCode (you will see a notification in the bottow left-hand corner of VSCode)

‚ùóÔ∏è _After you complete the above steps, you may need to click the assignment link again._
